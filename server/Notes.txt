> Redefine the spot positions for ‘flat'

Type “zc” for Zero Centroids.

> - Measure and calculate a reconstructor

Measure: type “measure” when looking at the beacon, in open loop but with the centroids near-ish to the centers of the boxes.

Compute: type “recon” but I’m not entirely sure this works and I have to test it. Better, you can:

“saveint” to save the interaction matrix, then

compute_reconstructor INFILE OUTFILE

(compute_reconstructor us a python script installed in /usr/local/bin )

> - find the 'default' positions for a good wavefront.
> - Close the loop


Type “close”, then “setflat”. To save this to file, type “savedef”.

Using PICO 1 and DICH-S2 step size of about 40 seems goog.

UP increases X 
DOWN decreases X
LEFT increases Y
RIGHT decreases Y

0.01 seems a goo maximum offset.

Testing Version 4.0 of the code. Still 

Z5 increases A2 decreases 0.005 -> 0.06
Z6 Increases A1 Increases 0.005 -> 0.06 But varries a lot
Foc Increases Focus Decreases 0.005 -> 0.1

Will save some aberration data to see what the varriation might be,

Saved both aberration and frame data.

Second aberration file will contain some changes.

ALl this is with the Retro mirror and the centroids have been set for that.
We will now try the corner cube.

Aberrations 001 - On flat mirror with flat.
002 - On flat mirror things changing.
003 On corner cube with flat defined by mirror.
004 on corner cube with flat defined by corner cube.
005 On corner cube with all defaults.
006 Same, software test

Seems moving by 0.005 is a good incriment on zernikes

Zernike 1 +ve focus goes more negative
Zernike 5 increase A2 goes more negative
Zernike 6 increase A1 goes more positive

It would be nice to add a scope on the astigmatism and focus terms

Automate this proceedure.

Found decent Zernike Positions

Z1 = 0.6800
Z5 = -0.0060
Z6 = 0.0200

In TR98 add step 7b repeat to ensure iris is in beam size
Check that we mention the S2WFS shutter
 
2015_06_09 Need to be able to change which file we use for defaults. IE change
between White light, laser and Blue LED zero points. PErhaps this can be done
on the fly?

Notes from John:

        Calibrating transfer matrices

took wavefront sensor data in UT 2015 Jun 17 data directory
004: az 69.8degs.  peak correlation for y-> -y, rotation = +5.0 degs 
005: az 172.2        peak correlation for y-> -y, pa = +106.0 degs

formula:
  x(TELWFS) = x(LABWFS) * cos( theta) + y(LABWFS)*sin(theta)
  y(TELWFS) = x(LABWFS) * sin(theta)  - y(LABWFS)*cos(theta)

theta = TELESCOPE AZIMUTH - 65.5 degs  ( errors +/- 1 deg)


Theo: Looks like a gain of 0.15 on X and -0.15 on Y works.....
